## About
My vimrc file.
It sets up some customizations to make [Vim] behave nicely,
but without overwhelming shortcuts and bindings.
All the plugins are managed by [Vundle], a vim bundle manager.

## The nice thing
At opening vim, the vimrc file check if [Vundle] is present on the machine.
If not, it automagically installs it and all the declared plugins, so
that the settings are immediately ready and up-to-date on any new machine.
Really nice isn't it?
